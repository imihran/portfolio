### Welcome to My Github

Hello, my name is Mihran Akopyan I go by Mish. Throughout my career, I developed a passion for data science and analytics.

**Project 1** – Automatic Reddit Analyzer and Visualizer - Build in Python

This script connects to Reddit and Google API. Pulls the top 20 hot posts from the AITA subreddit counts the votes and pushes that info to google sheets – where it gets visualized. The script is automatically run every hour in a virtual server from AWS. Here is the **[Project Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSGATLkDaSs9x3OhYfOsgm8Xwic61eXyqG1NZ-Y40QHg4UZlk9L1XikWOVY0QGPi71KlRtVO_eUZUAE/pubchart?oid=1753950542&format=interactive)** to the visualization.

**Project 2** – Power BI and Financial Data

Put together a large dataset of financial data and used Power BI to make a presentation. Video **[Project Link](https://youtu.be/NEpZe8PdqW8?list=PLyIglp94oFaoDm_jpBwIuLI7JBrdkQlGq)**

**Project 3** – Azure VM Mapping Tool - Build in Python

This tool is designed to take server inventory as an input CSV or excel file type and use the azure resource API to find the right virtual machine in order to find the respective pricing. **[Project Link](https://github.com/imihran/portfolio/tree/master/Public%20Project%20Files/mapping-tool)**

**Project 4** – Data Model

Built a data model (transaction/fraud/customer) using Excel Power Query to consolidate and visualize 10+ years of data from various reports. data had 60 + million rows and 100+ columns. No link is available because this is confidential information that has customer information.
